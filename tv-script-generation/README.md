# Generate TV Scripts

## Introduction

In this project, you'll generate your own Simpsons TV scripts using RNNs. You'll be using part of the Simpsons dataset of scripts from 27 seasons. The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new TV script for a scene at Moe's Tavern.

### Generated Script Sample
```
homer_simpson:(casual) oh, yeah. i'm a real expert.
moe_szyslak: what is that? a six-barrel, so i can just wonderin' no what i have a good drink.

homer_simpson: how about you?(laughs) whoa, sure, moe. i know why i was.
moe_szyslak: yeah, i never seen a lot of courage to wear suspenders more... uh, time

## Getting the project files

The project files can be found in our [public GitHub repo](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning), in the `tv-script-generation` folder. You can download the files from there, but it's better to clone the repository to your computer
```
git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning.git
```
This way you can stay up to date with any changes we make by pulling the changes to your local repository with `git pull`.
